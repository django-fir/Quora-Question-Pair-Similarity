# Quora Question Pair Similarity

## üìú Project Overview
This project predicts whether two questions on Quora are semantically similar. The solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze text data.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Preprocessing of question pairs using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, stemming).
- Creation of semantic embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **GloVe**.
- Feature engineering with advanced NLP metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, shared word ratio).
- Implementation of machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Achieved **85% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NLP: NLTK, SpaCy, Word2Vec, GloVe
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: [Quora Question Pairs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs)
- The dataset contains:
  - Pair of questions (`question1` and `question2`)
  - Target column indicating if the questions are duplicates (1 for similar, 0 for not similar).

---

## üîç Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and removed stopwords.
   - Performed stemming and lemmatization.
   - Created embeddings using Word2Vec and GloVe.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculated similarity metrics: Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Euclidean distance.
   - Extracted features like common word count, word overlap percentage, and token difference.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model optimization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, And F1-Score.

---

## üß© Results
- **Model Accuracy**: 85%
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.89
- The model successfully predicts duplicate questions, helping Quora improve user experience by reducing duplicate content.
